# Recipe-Resolver
The **Recipe-Resolver** is a a little tool for interpreting and resolving recipes given in an minimalistic plain text object notation. Originally created to resolve Recipes for playing the game Astroneer and a bit as recreational programming. From this I might rework my pton interpreter repo.

## TODO
* [ ] add more features and documentation
